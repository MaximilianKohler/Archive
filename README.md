My general goals:<br>
Copied from a recent discussion. 

> It would generally be based off of this: https://medium.com/@MaximilianKohler/a-critical-look-at-the-current-and-longstanding-ethos-of-childbearing-the-repercussions-its-been-6e37f7f7b13f and https://maximiliankohler.medium.com/eugenics-past-present-and-future-74d0ea5998b4
> 
> Increasing the health and well-being of ourselves and our planet to the point where we're at a sustainable equilibrium, and where the vast majority of the population is made up of only healthy high-functioning individuals. Reversing our Idiocracy and implementing steps to prevent it in the future. Increasing longevity to the point of an indefinite lifespan, and working toward the type of society described in Manna https://marshallbrain.com/manna, where we no longer have "mandatory work for a living", but do as we want, with most of the undesirable activities automated by machines. I am then interested in shaping our own biology to vastly increase our intelligence. Exploration of our universe will come shortly after.
> 
> I'm also reminded of Jacque Fresco and the Venus Project, who I've been a big fan of for a long time.

Moving things to a wiki here because the Reddit admins have steered Reddit into the sewer.
