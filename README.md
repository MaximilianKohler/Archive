Moving things here because the Reddit admins have steered Reddit into the sewer. https://github.com/MaximilianKohler/Archive/wiki/Reddit

I will update with more links soon.

### Some of the major problems:

* Infinite growth on a finite planet is suicide. Michael Moore Presents: Planet of the Humans. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x7UgKfSug0 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZige9bfXmU

* David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet (2020) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li5Xi9mIvDg - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64R2MYUt394 

* Having fewer children is the most effective step against climate change https://iopppublish.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Infographic-Climate-Choices-4.jpg

We've already depleted the oceans of fish, replaced them with plastic, oil, heavy metals and other industrial pollution. We're causing massive deforestation, climate change threatening huge populations, extinction of a huge variety of animal species. Extreme animal suffering due to horrendous factory farming conditions and habitat destruction. And causing a huge amount of human suffering, [much of which comes from the rises in chronic disease and poor health, both of which have been increasing drastically in recent decades. The vast majority of people now are nowhere near healthy enough to be ethically using their bodies to create other people](https://medium.com/@MaximilianKohler/a-critical-look-at-the-current-and-longstanding-ethos-of-childbearing-the-repercussions-its-been-6e37f7f7b13f).

### My general goals:<br>
Copied from a recent discussion. 
> It would generally be based off of this: https://medium.com/@MaximilianKohler/a-critical-look-at-the-current-and-longstanding-ethos-of-childbearing-the-repercussions-its-been-6e37f7f7b13f and https://maximiliankohler.medium.com/eugenics-past-present-and-future-74d0ea5998b4
> 
> Increasing the health and well-being of ourselves and our planet to the point where we're at a sustainable equilibrium, and where the vast majority of the population is made up of only healthy high-functioning individuals. Reversing our Idiocracy and implementing steps to prevent it in the future. Increasing longevity to the point of an indefinite lifespan, and working toward the type of society described in Manna https://marshallbrain.com/manna, where we no longer have "mandatory work for a living", but do as we want, with most of the undesirable activities automated by machines. I am then interested in shaping our own biology to vastly increase our intelligence. Exploration of our universe will come shortly after.

> I'm also reminded of Jacque Fresco and the Venus Project, who I've been a big fan of for a long time.

In my opinion the only way to fix things is by making people smarter. It's doable via [a variety of biological and societal interventions](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tdxb9ro5oaliwmc/Constituent%20Bill%20Proposal%20Form%20-%20for%20reddit.doc?dl=0).

The problem again is that it's low functioning (dumb) people preventing us from implementing these fixes. Possibly if enough intelligent people understand and agree on these fixes and be vocal enough about implementing them we could get it done. https://web.archive.org/web/20200602203523/https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dhsvud/there_was_a_recent_post_ranting_that_collapse_is/
