My general goals:<br>
Copied from a recent discussion. 
> My memory is extremely poor due to my poor health, and I haven't been thinking about things like that because it's largely useless until I'm at the point where I can actually do it. I've been focusing on finding stool donors. I have some extra time today though, so I've thought on it a bit. But my brain function is poor.
> 
> It would generally be based off of this: https://medium.com/@MaximilianKohler/a-critical-look-at-the-current-and-longstanding-ethos-of-childbearing-the-repercussions-its-been-6e37f7f7b13f and https://maximiliankohler.medium.com/eugenics-past-present-and-future-74d0ea5998b4
> 
> Increasing the health and well-being of ourselves and our planet to the point where we're at a sustainable equilibrium, and where the vast majority of the population is made up of only healthy high-functioning individuals. Reversing our Idiocracy and implementing steps to prevent it in the future. Increasing longevity to the point of an indefinite lifespan, and working toward the type of society described in Manna https://marshallbrain.com/manna, where we no longer have "mandatory work for a living", but do as we want, with most of the undesirable activities automated by machines. I am then interested in shaping our own biology to vastly increase our intelligence. Exploration of our universe will come shortly after.
> 
> Some of the benefits of having a commune made up of stool donors is both the support network of a bunch of healthy & competent people, as well as the ability to be surrounded by intelligent people, and thus can have important and useful discussions of all kinds, and use each other to grow. Including the question of "what should our goals and tenets be", as well as "what methods and steps to take to achieve our goals".
> 
> I'm also reminded of Jacque Fresco and the Venus Project, who I've been a big fan of for a long time.

Moving things to a wiki here because the Reddit admins have steered Reddit into the sewer.
